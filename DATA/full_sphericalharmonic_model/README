-----------------------------------
Transversly isotropic input models:
-----------------------------------

crust:
3D crustal files are spherical harmonic models up to degree 40 named C*.dat and MOHO.dat

mantle:
3D mantle files are spherical harmonic models up to degree 20 and parametrized on 21 splines 
with depths (similar to S20RTS) named M*.dat 

internal topography:
Mantle topgraphy files are spherical harmonic models up to degree 20 named T410.dat T660.dat and TCMB.dat

-------------------------------------

Provided model files are:

Example files for the crust are:
- Crust2.0 equivalent named *2.0.ylm, 
- Crust from Meier et al. (2007) named *mct.ylm

Example files for the mantle are:
- S20RTS files (see DATA/s20rts)

Examples files for topography are
- Meier et al. (2009) named 400.ylm and 660.ylm or multiplied by two 400_2.ylm 660_2.ylm
